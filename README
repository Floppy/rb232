== ABOUT

This library is intended to become a simple serial port access library for
Ruby. It will hopefully become a gem at some point, but it isn't there yet.

You may ask, why not just use ruby-serialport? Mainly because the GPL license
it is under is too restrictive for my purposes. This code is under the MIT
license, so you can do anything you like with it.

== STATUS

You can create a RB232::Port object and set options, but nothing much else.
We don't do any actual talking to the hardware yet. Watch this space!
