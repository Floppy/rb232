== ABOUT

This library is intended to become a simple serial port access library for
Ruby. It will hopefully become a gem at some point, but it isn't there yet.

You may ask, why not just use ruby-serialport? Mainly because the GPL license
it is under is too restrictive for my purposes. This code is under the MIT
license, so you can do anything you like with it.

== STATUS

Currently you can read from a serial port, but not write back. The code is only 
tested on Linux - other unixes *may* work, Mac OSX *might* be ok, but Windows
is right out for now. Watch this space for further developments!

== USAGE

The following code will read a 10-character string from the specified port,
using the default port settings (9600/8/n/1)

      @port = RB232::Port.new('/dev/ttyUSB0')
      message = @port.read_string(10)

You can provide alternative settings when you create a new port:

      RB232::Port.new('/dev/ttyS0', :baud_rate => 19200, 
                                    :data_bits => 7, 
                                    :parity => true, 
                                    :stop_bits => 2)
